# Plotly Based Orion Asterism
An unconventional use od scatter plots: Rotating Univers map to show Orion Asterism starts

Here you can see and rotate visible stars (8812 with HR): http://www.sinnefa.com/orion/
An ordinary scatter #plot used for something other than the usual, an experiment with Plotly and R.

# Notes:
1) The sun is intentionally larger and includes all our planets in its enlarged volume.
2) Stars within the boundaries of a constellation are actually spread out like a spurt of water, billions of billions of kilometers away.
3) Each star is possibly a solar system

# How I made it:
I used R and Plotly
I used the Bright Star Catalogue
I highlighted the orion constellation stars and imaginary lines
